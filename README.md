# Store Admin Portal

This web portal could be used to allow store admins to manage store items. The portal would allow admins to Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) store items. 

The portal would have a main page that shows a list of all the store items. This page would also have the option to edit or delete the item. 

The portal would also have an “Add Product Data” option, which would allow admins to add new items to the store. This  would require admins to enter information about the item, such as its name, description, and price . 

Overall, this web portal would provide store admins with a convenient way to manage store items. It would allow them to easily view, add, update, and delete items.
